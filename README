This is a speed optimized BSON encoder for c++11 . In order to encode BSON all you need is just the header files

ebson11.h	      - the main header - the only file needed to be explicitly included 
stringnum.h	    - performance optimized decimal string representation of a positive integer 64 bit, 
                  which can be incremented. 100 times faster than snprintf.  
uninit_vector.h - performance optimized std::vector replacement (30-50% improvs over std::vector in this case)

FILES

bsontest.cppmain test driver and usage example (self explanatory) - will build everywhere
bsoncompare_mongodb.cpp - performance comparison test driver to compare ebson11 and BSONObjectBuilder needs <chrono>

This is highly speed optimized BSON encoder for c++11 .

For usage see bsontest.cpp 

to build the example:
g++ -std=c++11 bsontest.cpp -o bsontest
